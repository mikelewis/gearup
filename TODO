- Status checks that client can query and worker can update. This means jobid... just use messageid? Yeaa. 
  - Set expiration time. How long? 1 day sounds good for those long jobs :)
  - Nice interface for worker. update_status :running, :update_status checking_mail, :update_status pinging. This means job needs messageid/jobid. (USE EM-REDIS :})
    - Needs a redis server to be up and running (set in config). If it's not running, no big deal.. just can't use status checks.
  - Always set init and end job by us (working, completed)
  - Should client create a ticket id if he/she wants to track it? Yea, that's not a bad idea. Or better yet, we create one for them and they can use it if they want. Yea that's good. Client.{job}("arg1") returns a job_id that they can later ping.
- Do CommandCenter (TCP interface?)
  -Add/remove workers via interface
- Add configuration for queue name, #workers(config.yml)
- Run CommandCenter.start(ARGS) from bin/gearup
- Then everything will exist within the CommandCenter module/class (keeping track of master/workers etc)
